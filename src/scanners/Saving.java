//Come up with 6 amounts of money you are willing to save up every month throughout half a year.
//You are willing to spend 1/3 of your saved up money on a new bike. How much money will you have left?
//       	 **keep in mind that int doesn't show the decimal points when you do 1/3; it will show a whole number

//How much money will you save each month?
//20
//35
//20
//40
//90
//How much money did you save up?
//205
//The amount of money you spent is: 68
